# Adversarial Review — tdd-task-loop/design (v1)

Tear apart this document and find every weakness — gaps, ambiguities, contradictions, unstated assumptions, failure modes that have not been considered. Do not validate or support. Use directive framing throughout.

## Target document
/home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp/.spec-workflow/specs/tdd-task-loop/design.md

## Execution context
- Workspace: /home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp
- Workflow root: /home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp

## Analysis approach

Before writing your analysis, read the target document. Then identify **3–6 specific topics, decisions, or sections** to attack — name actual headings, claims, or structures from the document. For each, list **3–5 directive bullets** grounded in the document's concrete content. Frame bullets as directives ("Challenge the claim that…", "Stress-test the assumption that…"), not questions. Do not write generic advice.

**Primary attack surface for this phase:** Feasibility, consistency, edge cases

**Example attack angles to consider:** Conflicts with steering docs, unaddressed failure modes, scaling bottlenecks, missing error paths, alternatives not considered

## Closing deliverables
- Top N risks/gaps (3 for short docs, 5 for long)
- Top 3 conclusions to challenge or reverse, with reasoning
- What's missing — work that should be done before acting on this document

Be specific and concrete. Cite failure scenarios, not abstract risks. If something
is actually fine, say so briefly and move on.

## Standing directives

- Ground every claim in the real codebase. Read the files the document cites before you judge them. A misstated artifact (wrong path, wrong line range, wrong signature, wrong behaviour) is an automatic MUST_FIX.
- Attack the deltas since the previous version first, then apply one fresh lens the prior rounds did not use.
- Rulings recorded in the document's Revision History are closed. Do not re-open them.
- Do not pad. MINOR-only findings do not keep the loop alive. A clean round is a valid result: show your work (what you checked and how) and say converged.
- Severity: MUST_FIX = contradiction, false claim about the codebase, unimplementable requirement, data or security hole. SHOULD_FIX = a real gap that causes rework or a wrong implementation. MINOR = wording, a value safely left to a later phase, nice-to-have.
- ESCALATE only when a human should look now: security, secrets, auth bypass, data loss, destructive migrations, money, billing, pricing, legal or compliance. Otherwise write `ESCALATE: none`.

## Verdict block

End the analysis file with exactly this block, values filled in:

```
VERDICT: converged | iterate
MUST_FIX: <n>
SHOULD_FIX: <n>
MINOR: <n>
DESIGN_READY: yes | no
ESCALATE: none | <one-line reason a human should look now>
```

`converged` requires MUST_FIX = 0 and SHOULD_FIX = 0.

## Output
Write your analysis to: /home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp/.spec-workflow/specs/tdd-task-loop/reviews/adversarial-analysis-design.md

## This round

- Read `/home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp/.spec-workflow/specs/tdd-task-loop/codebase-context.md` first; it maps the code this document cites. Start your code reads from it.
- Version under review: v1.
- Machine-verified: `spec-lint` ran citation-path, citation-range, citation-unchecked, citation-bare, citation-identifier, mdx, caps-invalid, doc-words on v1 and returned 0 findings. A rule with no finding listed here passed; verify meaning only. No lint pass ran (0 findings), so no lint commit changed a citation. Still open (error = MUST_FIX candidate, warning = your call, info = a note): none.
- Changes: the diff from the `docs(sdd): tdd-task-loop design v1` checkpoint to the working tree follows as `## Changes since <short sha>`, cut at 500 lines.
- First review. Read the decomposition entry for `tdd-task-loop` in `/home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp/.spec-workflow/spec-decomposition/decomposition.md` and check the document against its scope. The context file is drafter-written and unreviewed; re-probe any `## Probes` line the document relies on.
- The drafter re-decided one requirement literal: `R3 AC4 — redTests is an optional key that defaults to '' (empty string), so today's callers and tests keep passing`. Rule on it: `refinement` (closed) or `widening` (a MUST_FIX). State your ruling in the analysis.
- Fresh lens for this round: wire contracts across a boundary — the producer-to-consumer wires between the parsed-task shape, the check runner's captured stdout/stderr classification, the red-on-base proof, the gate wiring, the review record, and the judge's score-question wire form. The drafter flagged the judge's score-question wire as unprobed (no key) and stated a mismatch fails open; stress-test that wire and every other seam where one component's output shape must match another's expected input.
- A design sentence that names a specific library or framework API capability — a method, an option, or an exposed field — is a checkable claim, not prose. Confirm the document probed it against the installed version under `/home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp` and cited the probe, or stated only the behaviour it verified; an unproven library-capability assertion carried toward implementation is a MUST_FIX.
- Data Models completeness — any result or response object that a requirement references has its full field shape pinned in Data Models, not only its union arms. A named result object whose shape is given only through its union members, with no enumerated fields, is a MUST_FIX.
- Closed by ruling, do not re-open: none.
- Rejected findings from earlier rounds are recorded with their reasons in the Revision History and the memory file. This is round 1; there are none.
- Rolling memory file: `/home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp/.spec-workflow/specs/tdd-task-loop/reviews/adversarial-memory-design.md`. The scaffold above does not mention it on the first round. Create it after your analysis, in the format later rounds expect: `# Adversarial Review Memory — design`, `Last updated`, `## Cumulative Findings Summary` (Accepted / Partially Accepted / Rejected / Unresolved, every finding of this round under Unresolved), `## Patterns & Themes`, `## Guidance for Next Review`.
- Code lives under `/home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp`; the spec store under `/home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp/.spec-workflow`. Use absolute paths. Project rules for reading code and running checks: `/home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp/.spec-workflow/agent-rules.md`.
- Do not edit the document or any file other than your analysis and the memory file.

## Code graph
Graph: `/home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp/graphify-out/graph.json` (the code graph of the code root).
- `graphify explain "<symbol>" --graph /home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp/graphify-out/graph.json`: one symbol and its edges. Use it first.
- `graphify path "A" "B" --graph /home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp/graphify-out/graph.json`: the chain between two symbols.
- `graphify query "<terms>" --budget 800 --graph /home/mcf/repo/spec-workflow-mcp/graphify-out/graph.json`: one area; take the terms from the graph's labels.
Rule: run `explain` on a symbol before you open its code file, then read only the cited range to confirm it. Never use the graph for the spec store. When `explain` prints "No node matching", read the file as before. An `[INFERRED]` edge is never a citation. A citation in a document or the context file names a range you read.
