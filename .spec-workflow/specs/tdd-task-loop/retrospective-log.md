# Retrospective log — tdd-task-loop

## 2026-09-27T20:03:06Z · requirements · v1 · gotcha
Drafter raised RE-DECIDED flags vs decomposition entry 11, for the round-1 reviewer to rule (refinement=closed | widening=MUST_FIX): (1) e2e scenario — an honest author reports the already-met task RED-IMPOSSIBLE so that task never reaches the gate; an in-process gate call proves the vacuous-base fail instead; (2) the proof base is the red commit's parent, not the gate's baseRef. Plus informational flag: D4 counts the author's files for tests-not-touched, so risk comes out lower than today's inputs would give. Lint clean 0/0/0; gate-a surface holds 5 ranked items (posture n/a ranked last, spec touches no money/PII).
Evidence: requirements.md v1; gate-a.json
Cost: drafter spawn (recorded)
