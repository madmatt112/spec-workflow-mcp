# Adversarial Review — worktree-execution-context/design (v2)

Tear apart this document and find every weakness — gaps, ambiguities, contradictions, unstated assumptions, failure modes that have not been considered. Do not validate or support. Use directive framing throughout.

## Target document
/home/mcf/reference/spec-workflow-mcp/.spec-workflow/specs/worktree-execution-context/design.md

## Prior review context

This is review v2. Before attacking the target document:

1. Read the rolling memory file at /home/mcf/reference/spec-workflow-mcp/.spec-workflow/specs/worktree-execution-context/reviews/adversarial-memory-design.md (it may not exist yet — the file is created/updated by each v2+ review).
2. Read the latest prior analysis at /home/mcf/reference/spec-workflow-mcp/.spec-workflow/specs/worktree-execution-context/reviews/adversarial-analysis-design.md to understand what was found most recently.
3. Classify each finding you produce as one of:
   - **Novel**: not identified in any prior review.
   - **Compounding**: builds on or deepens a prior finding.
   - **Recurring**: same issue identified before but not yet resolved — escalate severity.
4. Focus on novel and compounding issues. Do not re-discover known findings unless they remain unresolved.
5. After completing your analysis, write an UPDATED memory file to /home/mcf/reference/spec-workflow-mcp/.spec-workflow/specs/worktree-execution-context/reviews/adversarial-memory-design.md using this format:

```markdown
# Adversarial Review Memory — design
Last updated: <today's date> (after v2 review)

## Cumulative Findings Summary
### Accepted
- <finding>: <brief description, which version identified it>

### Partially Accepted
- <finding>: <brief description, user's stance>

### Rejected
- <finding>: <brief description, reason for rejection>

### Unresolved
- <finding>: <not yet responded to>

## Patterns & Themes
- <high-level observations about recurring issues>

## Guidance for Next Review
- Focus areas based on what's been found
- Areas that have been well-covered and don't need re-examination
```

## Analysis approach

Before writing your analysis, read the target document. Then identify **3–6 specific topics, decisions, or sections** to attack — name actual headings, claims, or structures from the document. For each, list **3–5 directive bullets** grounded in the document's concrete content. Frame bullets as directives ("Challenge the claim that…", "Stress-test the assumption that…"), not questions. Do not write generic advice.

**Primary attack surface for this phase:** Feasibility, consistency, edge cases

**Example attack angles to consider:** Conflicts with steering docs, unaddressed failure modes, scaling bottlenecks, missing error paths, alternatives not considered

## Closing deliverables
- Top N risks/gaps (3 for short docs, 5 for long)
- Top 3 conclusions to challenge or reverse, with reasoning
- What's missing — work that should be done before acting on this document

Be specific and concrete. Cite failure scenarios, not abstract risks. If something
is actually fine, say so briefly and move on.

## Output
Write your analysis to: /home/mcf/reference/spec-workflow-mcp/.spec-workflow/specs/worktree-execution-context/reviews/adversarial-analysis-design-r2.md
